When I was a child, my grandfather penned a nickname for me. He called me "chili chithra" due to my love for all things spicy. I can't count the number the times people have asked me if I wanted some main course to go with my hot sauce.

With hot sauce being such an integral part of my life, I think about it a little more that is normal. Obviously, my first full-stack app had to be hot sauce related... because, obviously.

I built HAWT SAWCE using a RoR backend, PostgreSQL backend, and React/Redux front-end. All the development and design is my own work. Being a one woman design and dev shop was REALLY hard. I found myself Rubber Duck Debugging all the time, and felt like I became my own best friend/worst enemy. The best part of being alone was that I could work at whatever hours I wanted. There were no dependencies on external players, and thus I was able to stick to and beat my projected timelines.
