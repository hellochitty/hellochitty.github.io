The concept for Legit was inspired by a game I used to play with my dad in the car as a child. Heâ€™d skip to a random song on a cassette and play a small snippet of a track, which I would then have to identify. Based on that, I created a JavaScript game utilizing the Spotify API that will test you on how well you know the songs in your playlists. The game is purely JS, and all the development/design is my own work. Checkout my code on [github](https://github.com/hellochitty/Legit).

Users authenticate the app using OAuth2.0, after which they are able to view and select their playlists.

After choosing a playlist, the User then has to listen to snippets of 10 songs, identifying each of them
