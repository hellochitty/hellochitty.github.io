[“Touted as “LEGO for the iPad generation”, littleBits is a library of modular electronics that snap together to create complex circuits and prototype creative products in no time.”][little-bits]
<br><br>
I’ve been a fan of littleBits since I saw them present at New York Tech Meetup a few years ago. Seeing as I wanted to do a product development/UI project today, I thought I’d do one for littleBits!
<br><br>
First, I started by thinking of something I didn’t see on the litteBits site that could be cool for users to explore, and would help them in their creative process. After some thinking, I came up with the concept of the “sandbox.” The sandbox is a place where users can create litteBits projects virtually. The user can add their bits to their workspace and connect them, after which they can hit the simulate button and see if their project actually works. Of course, the backend that would need to be created to determine if the circuit works would probably be complicated, but why not dream big! It would be so cool to simulate a project before buying the pieces.
<br><br>
This project is a tool to fill the needs of a creative maker persona, who has limited experience with electronics but is very interested in dabbling in the field. They typically work on side projects or other creative work and know that the electricity angle could add a new dimension to their creations. Their problem is getting started in the discovery and learning process, as they don’t know exactly where to start.
<br><br>
I see this app as almost a self guided introduction into electronics and littleBits. As someone who spends 1 hour a day in trains, I’m always looking for something to make that hour engaging in some way, which usually involves listening to podcasts (99% invisible and tim ferriss are my favourites). This app would be an interactive and fun way to educate people in those hours. The littleBits used in the project can subsequently be purchased to create the project in the physical world!
<br><br>
Note: littleBits already has a website where people can post their projects, so I used elements of the existing screens to inspire me.
<br><br>
Currently (as of early 2015), there is no iPhone app for littleBits, so I incorporated some of my ideas of what I would include if I was building it. There are a lot of other pages I’d probably want to include, but I wanted to keep things simple and focus on the sandbox.

A simple spashpage gets the user excited about the app.

Explore!: see other peoples projects, and get inspired. This is where the user would land upon opening the app. After perusing other people’s projects and upvoting the ones that the user finds interesting, the user will proceed to work on their own projects.

They then press the hamburger button to land on the side-menu, which offers a simple set of navigation options.

When the user enters the sandbox, they are greeted with their past projects (which they can update or delete). This is also where they would create a new project.

After either selecting an existing project, or creating a new project, the user enters the workspace where they will interact with all of the littleBits. The bottom left hand shopping cart icon allows the user to add all the bits in their workspace to their shopping cart for easy checkout. (This will be fleshed out in version 2 of this project)

By clicking the plus sign in the top right-hand corner, the user is able to add bits to their workspace. The “Add Bits” menu has the pieces organized by function so that they user can discover new pieces easily and select the ones they need.

After creating a project, the user can then save the project, add a description, upload images, supplement the project with instructions, and publish the project.

As I continue to think about this project a week after I created it, I find that there could be some additional uses to this tool. Why not make it a game to help young people learn about electronics? Challenges could be created ex: to create a lightbulb with switch using littleBits, and the user can earn badges or go up in levels as they create various littleBits projects. This could be a great way to engage children and students with both electronics and the littleBits product!
